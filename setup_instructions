I'm currently working on a smart factory project assigned with the development of the backend part of things.
 
The factory is a semiconductor part factory providing spare parts for larger factories. There are about 20 manufacturing process lines that the factory have of and a variety of parts that the factory needs to process. Each process line can receive parts or components to process and a part could be processed in a series of ordered steps. 

The manager of the factory is responsible for inputting what processes a part will need to go through from a manager dashboard panel. The manager will be able to add parts to different process lines and monitor the progress of each process lines. While the workers of the factory have their own dashboard panel to see the list of parts they need to process - according to their assigned process line- and either start/end the process of a part by a push of a button. 

For example: part A will need to go through process lines 1-3-5. First, the manager will input choose the part A and assign it to process lines 1-3-5. After that the workers in the process line 1 will receive part A which they will need to process. Then, after process line 1 is done with part A (the worker clicked the end button), part A will move on to the tablet of process line 3 and notify the workers on process line 3 to start the process on part A. This will continue until part A reaches process line 5. 

There will be other parts which might need to go more process lines, but the flow will much or less be the same with the example above. 

Now your job as an backend engineer includes the development of: 
- Login system: Simple login system for managers and workers to log in 
- Process management system: System that enables managers to configure process steps a part need to go through and configure each process line 
- Real-time monitoring: Current status of each processing line, how many parts that have finished all process, which processing lines is experiencing delays, average processing time for a part in a specific process line, and other smart factory monitoring KPI 
- Reporting: Reporting of important factory KPIs such as total production of the day, performance of each process line, performance of individual workers, etc

What I want you to do now is:
- Setup a readable file structure to accomodate all the features mentioned
- Setup mqtt for real time update and monitoring
- Setup MongoDB connection
